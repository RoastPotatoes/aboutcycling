After a disastrous puncture that woudln't, seal I bought new tyres with an additional 2mm.
Now running Eagle F1 R which turned out to be very difficult to fit despite them being one of the easier tubeless tyres to fit. 
Took a total of 3 hours to seat both tyres. I believe I need an additional strip of rim tape to make them tighter as this was a very painful process.

Added a Tortec Ultralite 560g pannier rack
