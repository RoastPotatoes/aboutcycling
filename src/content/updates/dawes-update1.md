Replaced front cantilever with a newer less complicated Shimano CX-50. Increases braking power and adds the feature of a quick release so I don't have to deflate the tyre when removing the wheel.
Try as I did to move away from the cantilevers I had to move back. Now the front and rear are Shimano CX-50 which I have found remarkably easier to set up than the older model.
